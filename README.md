# Heshtok 

_[Just shut up already you incomprehensible piece of ...] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eczXvMGHuyQ)_

Heshtok, named after the Vorcha homeworld in Mass Effect, is an inhospitable and terrible planet, just like the CCP YAML dump. So the name fits.

Heshtok is a "CCP YAML" to MongoDB importer - and database model interface.

# Requirements
Patience, lots of patience.. CCP doesn't do things right.. Not the first time, nor the 2nd.. Or 3rd..

PHP YAML package https://pecl.php.net/package/yaml

# Installation / Usage
1. Get composer from `https://getcomposer.org/`
2. Install packages with composer: `php7.0 composer.phar install -o`
3. Run: ./bin/heshtok start --help to see what you can set. (Default is the db called ccp, and use of your machines /tmp/ directory)
