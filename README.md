# Heshtok 

_[Just shut up already you incomprehensible piece of ...] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eczXvMGHuyQ)_

Heshtok, named after the Vorcha homeworld in Mass Effect, is an inhospitable and terrible planet, just like the CCP YAML dump. So the name fits.

Heshtok is a "CCP YAML" to MongoDB importer - and database model interface.

# Requirements
Patience, lots of patience.. CCP doesn't do things right.. Not the first time, nor the 2nd.. Or 3rd..
